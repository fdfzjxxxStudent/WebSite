        Yesterday, my mother made a big decision: Tidy up my messy room. Why is it a big dicision? Because we haven¡¯t tidied my room for a long time. My bookshelf is the biggest problem. There are a lot of picture books when I was in kindergarten, and a lot of textbooks when I was in primary school (I am a middle school student now). They are all on my bookshelf and there aren¡¯t any place to put new things on it! So we must willing to throw some old things to put new things here. After we finish this, we can finish arrange the other places quickly. My mother thought it must spend a lot of time to make my room neat.
