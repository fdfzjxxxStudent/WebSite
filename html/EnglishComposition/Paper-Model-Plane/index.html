    <h1 id="title2">Paper Model Plane</h1>
    <h2 id="text">
        On today¡¯s table-tennis lesson, one of my classmate called Huang Jiajie did not play ping-pang. She made a paper model plane with four pieces of papers! The plane was very nice.

    <h2 id="text">
        The paper model plane just liked an actual plane. It had four wings and a body. But it was more colorful than other planes. Of course, it couldn¡¯t touch water! Because it was made of papers. Though it was not very strong, but it was very beautiful. I liked it very much.

        What a wonderful plane!
