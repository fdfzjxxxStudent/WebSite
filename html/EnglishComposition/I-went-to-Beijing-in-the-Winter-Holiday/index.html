        This winter holiday, I went to Beijing with my parents. We took a plane there. When we arrived, it was late at night. We went to the ¡®Sheraton the Great Wall¡¯ hotel as quickly as possible.

        On the third day of the journey, my father and I went to a park. There were a lot of snow there. We made a snowman and a lot of snowballs. We enjoyed ourselves.

        On the rest of the journey, my family went to Quanjude Roasted Duck Restaurant. We ate Roasted Duck there. It was very delicious. We liked it very much. My father and I also went to Tsinghua University and Beijing University. It was big and beautiful. I wished to go to learn there when I grow up.
